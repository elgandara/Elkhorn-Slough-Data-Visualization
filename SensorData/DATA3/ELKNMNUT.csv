 The best available dataset does not include values where the flag code is <0 (data outside sensor limits; rejected data; missing data; and optional SWMP
 supported data that were not collected).  If you wish to export all this data... you must choose the All Inclusive Data button.  

Please refer to the Read Me document bundled in the ZIP file for important information regarding data QAQC and data file contents.  A
metadata document will also be available detailing specific Reserve and station data collection methods; QAQC; and contact information.

---INFO ON FIELDS---
Collection method: A value of 1 represents grab sample collection - a value of 2 represents the diel auto-sampling program
Replicate: Refers to the sequential replicate number or a value of S indicates a laboratory split
PO4F: orthophosphate measured in milligrams per Liter (mg/L) as P 
NH4F: ammonium measured in milligrams per Liter (mg/L) as N
NO2F: nitrite measured in milligrams per Liter (mg/L) as N
NO3F: nitrate measured in milligrams per Liter (mg/L) as N
NO23F: nitrite + nitrate measured in milligrams per Liter (mg/L) as N
CHLA_N: chlorophyll a measured in micrograms per Liter (ug/L)

Provisional Plus: A value of 0 in the provisional plus column indicates that the data have been through the automated flagging process (primary QAQC) ONLY and has not been checked by the Reserve.
  While a value of 1 in the provisional plus column indicates that the data have been through secondary QAQC at the Reserve using Excel macros (provided by the CDMO) to further QAQC the data.

Historical: A value of 0 in the historical column indicates that the data have not been through final QAQC by the CDMO. A value of 1 indicates that the data have been through
 final tertiary review at the CDMO and posted as the final authoritative data. 

isSWMP:  A value of P indicates that this is a primary SWMP station and will ultimately go through tertiary review by the CDMO.  A value of S indicates that this is a secondary SWMP station. 
Secondary SWMP stations must follow all SWMP SOPs but do not go through tertiary review.

---FLAG CODES---

Each SWMP required parameter in the dataset is followed by a flag column (where the parameter header is preceded by a F_).  Flag values are defined as:   

-5         Outside High Sensor Range
-4         Outside Low Sensor Range
-3         Data Rejected due to QAQC
-2         Missing Data
-1         Optional SWMP supported parameter
 0         Passed Initial QAQC Checks
 1         Suspect Data
 2         Open - reserved for later flag
 3         Open - reserved for later flag
 4         Historical Data:  Pre-Auto QAQC
 5         Corrected Data
